Hi!..You know me a little bit. But it is now your turn!..I have a couple of questions that I would like you to answer!..

First of all, in YAML part, change the "title" of this document as you wish and replace the "author" with your name. 

Afterwards, tell me about yourself in a 3-4 sentences. 
What grade student are you?
"Emphasis" and list the courses (in an unordered way) which you liked so much at ITU (this semester courses are not included).
List the subjects you have liked most (in an ordered way).
Type the equation of one of the polynomial functions you like most. 
Give me a link one of the books you have read and liked so much.
Show me an image of the city where you are currently living in (import image from web, otherwise i cannot see it).
Copy and paste one of the emojis you use frequently in your daily life. 
 
Looking forward to hearing from you!..
